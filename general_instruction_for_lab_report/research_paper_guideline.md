Writing a Chemistry Research Paper

Title:

\- Keep the title short, include the author\'s name

\- Use essential keywords to describe the paper\'s content

Abstract:

\- Briefly state the purpose of this research

\- Summarize the main concepts, scope, findings, and conclusions

Introduction:

\- State the problem and reason for completing this research

\- Discuss any techniques used

\- Review the relevant research literature published on this topic
(citing your sources) and relate your current research to this
literature

Experimental Details\*:

\- Describe the experimental procedures used (so that other researchers
can replicate your research)

\- Include information about the reaction and processes: list the
materials & apparatus used in your experiment (mass of materials
before/after, percent yield), and the process mechanism

\- List the materials & apparatus used in your experiment

\- Summarize the data you collected (e.g. in table format)

\- Summarize the statistical analysis you used on the data
(calculations)

Results:

\- Describe the experimental procedures used (so that other researchers
can replicate your research)

\- Include information about the reaction and processes: list the
materials & apparatus used in your experiment (mass of materials
before/after, percent yield), and the process mechanism

\- List the materials & apparatus used in your experiment

\- Summarize the data you collected (e.g. in table format)

\- Summarize the statistical analysis you used on the data

Discussion\*\*:

\- Discuss & interpret what your results mean and relate them to the
stated problem. Are there possible solutions to suggest?

\- Relate your findings to the research literature on this topic (citing
sources)

Conclusion & Summary:

\- State a brief conclusion to this research, if not already stated in
the Discussion section

\- In this section, you can make possible suggestions for future
research on this topic

References:

\- List all the research papers whose work you discussed and cited in
the text of this paper

Appendices:

\- May be required (e.g. to list raw data that was collected)

\*Alternative titles: Experimental, Experimental Section, Theoretical
Analysis, or Materials & Methods.

\*\*The Discussion and Conclusion are often combined into one section.
